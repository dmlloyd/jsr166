/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task on one
 * of several pooled threads.
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems at the same time:
 * they usually provide improved performance when executing large
 * numbers of asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation
 * overhead, and they provide a means of bounding and managing the
 * resources, including threads, consumed in executing a collection of
 * tasks.
 *
 * <p>This class is very configurable and can be configured to create
 * a new thread for each task, or even to execute tasks sequentially
 * in a single thread, in addition to its most common configuration,
 * which reuses a pool of threads.
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks.
 * However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient factory
 * methods <tt>newCachedThreadPool</tt> (unbounded thread pool, with
 * automatic thread reclamation), <tt>newFixedThreadPool</tt> (fixed
 * size thread pool), <tt>newSingleThreadExecutor</tt> (single
 * background thread for execution of tasks), and
 * <tt>newThreadPerTaskExeceutor</tt> (execute each task in a new
 * thread), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 * scenarios.
 *
 *
 * <p>This class also maintain some basic statistics, such as the
 * number of completed tasks, that may be useful for monitoring and
 * tuning executors.
 *
 * <h3>Tuning guide</h3>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Minimum and maximum pool size</dt>
 * <dd>ThreadExecutor will
 * automatically adjust the pool size within the bounds set by
 * minimumPoolSize and maximumPoolSize.  When a new task is submitted,
 * and fewer than the minimum number of threads are running, a new
 * thread is created to handle the request, even if other worker
 * threads are idle.  If there are more than the minimum but less than
 * the maximum number of threads running, a new thread will be created
 * only if all other threads are busy.  By setting minimumPoolSize and
 * maximumPoolSize to N, you create a fixed-size thread pool.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive</dt>
 * <dd>The keepAliveTime determines what happens to idle
 * threads.  If the pool currently has more than the minimum number of
 * threads, excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle
 * for more than the keepAliveTime.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queueing</dt>
 * <dd>You are free to specify the queuing mechanism used
 * to handle submitted tasks.  The newCachedThreadPool factory method
 * uses queueless synchronous channels to to hand off work to threads.
 * This is a safe, conservative policy that avoids lockups when
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 * The newFixedThreadPool factory method uses a LinkedBlockingQueue,
 * which will cause new tasks to be queued in cases where all
 * MaximumPoolSize threads are busy.  Queues are sometimes appropriate
 * when each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 * affect each others execution. For example, in an http server.  When
 * given a choice, this pool always prefers adding a new thread rather
 * than queueing if there are currently fewer than the current
 * getMinimumPoolSize threads running, but otherwise always prefers
 * queuing a request rather than adding a new thread.
 *
 * <p>While queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient bursts of
 * requests, especially in socket-based services, it is not very well
 * behaved when commands continue to arrive on average faster than
 * they can be processed.  Using a bounded queue implements an overflow
 * policy which drops requests which cannot be handled due to insufficient
 * capacity.
 *
 * Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes can often be traded off for each
 * other. Using large queues and small pools minimizes CPU usage, OS
 * resources, and context-switching overhead, but can lead to
 * artifically low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for example
 * if they are I/O bound), a JVM and underlying OS may be able to
 * schedule time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of
 * small queues or queueless handoffs generally requires larger pool
 * sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but may encounter unacceptable
 * scheduling overhead, which also decreases throughput.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 * <dd>New threads are created through the
 * Callbacks.  By default, threads are created simply with
 * the new Thread(Runnable) constructor, but by overriding
 * Callbacks.newThread, you can alter the thread's name,
 * thread group, priority, daemon status, etc.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Before and after intercepts</dt>
 * <dd>The Callbacks class has
 * methods which are called before and after execution of a task.
 * These can be used to manipulate the execution environment (for
 * example, reinitializing ThreadLocals), gather statistics, or
 * perform logging.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Blocked execution</dt>
 * <dd>There are a number of factors which can
 * bound the number of tasks which can execute at once, including the
 * maximum pool size and the queuing mechanism used.  If you are using
 * a synchronous queue, the execute() method will block until threads
 * are available to execute.  If you are using a bounded queue, then
 * tasks will be discarded if the bound is reached.  If the executor
 * determines that a task cannot be executed because it has been
 * refused by the queue and no threads are available, the
 * cannotExecute method will be called.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Termination</dt>
 * <dd>ThreadExecutor supports two shutdown options,
 * immediate and graceful.  In an immediate shutdown, any threads
 * currently executing are interrupted, and any tasks not yet begun
 * are returned from the shutdownNow call.  In a graceful shutdown,
 * all queued tasks are allowed to run, but new tasks may not be
 * submitted.
