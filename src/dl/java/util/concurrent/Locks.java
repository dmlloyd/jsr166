/**
 * Utility operations for built-in synchronization and {@link Lock} classes.
 * <p>The <tt>Locks</tt> class defines utility methods that enhance the
 * use of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>allowing for an attempt to acquire a monitor lock only if it is free,
 * or if it becomes free within a specified time;
 * <li>allowing an attempt to acquire a monitor lock to be interruptible; and
 * <li>providing a method to acquire multiple monitor locks only if
 * they are all available.
 * </ul>
 * <p>An additional convenience method is provided to acquire multiple
 * {@link Lock} instances only if they are all available.
 * <p>To preserve the block-structured locking that is required for the
 * built-in monitor locks, each method takes a {@link Runnable} action as
 * an argument and executes its {@link Runnable#run run} method with the
 * appropriate locks held.
 * When the {@link Runnable#run run} method completes all locks
 * are released.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> All methods that take {@link Object} parameters treat
 * those parameters as {@link Object Objects}, even if they happen to be
 * {@link Lock} instances. These methods will always acquire the monitor
 * lock of the given object - they will not perform a {@link Lock#lock}
 * invocation.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> value for any parameter
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>
 * <p>When a {@link Runnable} object's {@link Runnable#run run} method is
 * executed it means that the appropriate
 * lock (or locks) has been acquired, and so the memory synchronization
 * effects of acquiring that lock will have taken place. Similarly, when
 * the {@link Runnable} object's {@link Runnable#run run} method completes,
 * the lock (or locks) is released and the associated memory synchronization
 * effects will take place. Exactly what those memory synchronization
 * effects are will depend on the nature of the lock and the type of
 * acquisition/release - for example, reentrantly acquiring a monitor lock
 * has no associated memory synchronization effects.
 * <p>When mutliple locks are involved it may be that some of the locks are
 * acquired and subsequently released, before an unavailable lock is found.
 * In that case the memory synchronization effects will be those of the locks
 * that were actually acquired and actually released.

     * return the monitor lock is
     * reacquired and the lock count restored to what it was when the

     * <li>If a thread is {@link Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting

     * thrown, and the thread's interrupted status will be cleared.

     * to <tt>put</tt> and <tt>take</tt> items in/from the buffer. If a
     * <tt>take</tt> is attempted on an empty buffer then the thread will block
     * until an item becomes available; if a <tt>put</tt> is attempted on a
     * full buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available.
     * We would like to keep waiting <tt>put</tt> threads and <tt>take</tt>
     * threads in separate wait-sets so that we can use the optimisation of
     * only notifying a single thread at a time when items, or spaces, become
     * available in the buffer. This can be achieved using either two
     * {@link Condition} instances, or one {@link Condition} instance and the
