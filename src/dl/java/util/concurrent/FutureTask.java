/**
 * A cancellable asynchronous computation.
 *
 * <p>Provides methods to start and cancel the computation, query to see if
 * the computation is complete, and retrieve the result of the computation.
 * The result can only be retrieved when the computation has completed;
 * the <tt>get</tt> method will block if the computation has not yet completed.
 * Once the computation is completed, the result cannot be changed, nor can the
 * computation be restarted or cancelled.
 *
 * <p>Because <tt>FutureTask</tt> implements <tt>Runnable</tt>, a
 * <tt>FutureTask</tt> can be submitted to an {@link Executor} for
 * current or deferred execution.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>FutureTask</tt> can be used to wrap a <tt>Callable</tt> or
 * <tt>Runnable</tt> object so that it can be scheduled for execution in a
 * thread or an <tt>Executor</tt>, cancel
 * computation before the computation completes, and wait for or
 * retrieve the results.  If the computation threw an exception, the
 * exception is propagated to any thread that attempts to retrieve the
 * result.
