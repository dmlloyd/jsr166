/**
 * A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> is a {@link java.util.Queue} that
 * additionally supports operations that wait for elements to exist
 * when taking them, and wait for space to exist when putting them.
 *
 * <p><tt>BlockingQueues</tt> are capacity bounded -- they have a
 * <tt>maximumSize</tt> beyond which no additional elements can be
 * <tt>put</tt> without blocking.  However, in some
 * implementations, a bound of <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt> may be used,
 * which serves only as a safeguard against infinite growth.
 *
 * <p> <tt>BlockingQueues</tt> do not accept <tt>null</tt> elements.
 * Implementations throw <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt> on attempts
 * to <tt>add</tt>, <tt>put</tt> or <tt>offer</tt> a <tt>null</tt>.  A
 * <tt>null</tt> is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
 * <tt>poll</tt> operations.
 *
 * <p> While <tt>BlockingQueues</tt> are designed to be used primarily
 * as producer-consumer queues, they support the <tt>Collection</tt>
 * interface. So for example, it is possible to remove an arbitrary
 * element from within a queue using <tt>remove(x)</tt>. However,
 * such operations are in general <em>NOT</em> performed very
 * efficiently, and are intended for only occasional use; for example,
 * when a queued message is cancelled. Also, the bulk operations, most
 * notably <tt>addAll</tt> are <em>NOT</em> performed atomically, so
 * it is possible for <tt>addAll(c)</tt> to fail (throwing an
 * exception) after adding only some of the elements in <tt>c</tt>.
 *
 * <p><tt>BlockingQueue</tt>s do <em>not</em> intrinsically support
 * any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to
 * indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
 * such features tend to be implementation dependent. For example, a
 * common tactic is for producers to insert special
 * <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are
 * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage example. Here is a sketch of a classic producer-consumer program.
 * <pre>
 * class Producer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while(true) { queue.put(produce()); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   Object produce() { ... }
 * }
 *
 *
 * class Consumer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Concumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while(true) { consume(queue.take()); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   void consume(Object x) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Setup {
 *   void main() {
 *     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
 *     Producer p = new Producer(q);
 *     Consumer c = new Consumer(q);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 *     new Thread(c).start();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
