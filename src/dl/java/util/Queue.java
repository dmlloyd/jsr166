/**
 * A Collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
 * Besides basic {@link Collection} operations, queues provide
 * additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
 *
 * <p>Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a
 * FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.  Among the exceptions are priority
 * queues, which order elements according to a supplied comparators, or
 * the elements natural ordering.  Every Queue implementation must specify
 * its ordering guarantees.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #offer(E)} method adds an element if possible, otherwise
 * returning <tt>false</tt>.  This differs from the {@link
 * Collections#add(Object)} method, which throws an unchecked exception upon
 * failure. It is designed for use in collections in which failure to
 * add is a normal, rather than exceptional occurrence, for example,
 * in fixed-capacity (or &ldquo;bounded&rdquo;) queues.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #remove()} and {@link #poll()} methods remove and return an
 * element in accord with the implementation's ordering policy. For example,
 * in FIFO queues, they remove and return the oldest element in the queue.
 * The <tt>remove()</tt> and <tt>poll()</tt> methods differ only in their
 * behavior when the queue is empty: the <tt>remove()</tt> method throws an
 * exception, while the <tt>poll()</tt> method returns <tt>null</tt>.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #element()} and {@link #peek()} methods return but do
 * not delete the element that would be obtained by a call to
 * the <tt>remove</tt> and <tt>poll</tt> methods respectively.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>Queue</tt> interface does not define the <i>blocking queue
 * methods</i>, which are common in concurrent programming.  These methods,
 * which wait for elements to appear or for space to become available, are
 * defined in the {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} interface, which
 * extends this interface.
 *
 * <p><tt>Queue</tt> implementations generally do not allow insertion of
 * <tt>null</tt> elements.  Even in the few implementations that permit it,
 * it is a bad idea, as <tt>null</tt> is also used as a special return value
 * by the <tt>poll</tt> method to indicate that the queue contains no
 * elements.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
