/**
 * A {@link BlockingQueue} in which producers may wait for consumers
 * to receive elements.  A <tt>TransferQueue</tt> may be useful for
 * example in message passing applications in which producers
 * sometimes (using method <tt>transfer</tt>) await receipt of
 * elements by consumers invoking <tt>take</tt> or <tt>poll</tt>,
 * while at other times enqueue elements (via method <tt>put</tt>)
 * without waiting for receipt. Non-blocking and time-out versions of
 * <tt>tryTransfer</tt> are also available.  A TransferQueue may also
 * be queried via <tt>hasWaitingConsumer</tt> whether there are any
 * threads waiting for items, which is a converse analogy to a
 * <tt>peek</tt> operation
 *
 * <p>Like any <tt>BlockingQueue</tt>, a <tt>TransferQueue</tt> may be
 * capacity bounded. If so, an attempted <tt>transfer</tt> operation
 * may initially block waiting for available space, and/or
 * subsequently block waiting for reception by a consumer.  Note that
 * in a queue with zero capacity, such as {@link SynchronousQueue},
 * <tt>put</tt> and <tt>transfer</tt> are effectively synonymous.
