/**
 * A synchronization barrier for ForkJoinTasks.  A TaskBarrier is
 * similar in functionality to a {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier}, but differs in the following
 * ways.
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> The number of parties may vary over time.  A task may register
 * to be a party in a barrier at any time (but almost always before
 * being forked), and may deregister upon arriving at the barrier.  As
 * is the case with most other basic synchronization constructs,
 * registration and deregistration affect only internal counts; they
 * do not establish any further internal bookkeeping.
 *
 * <li> TaskBarriers support split-phase operation: The two aspects of
 * coordination, arriving at a barrier (<tt>arrive</tt>) and awaiting
 * others (<tt>awaitCycleAdvance</tt>) are independently supported.
 * Like a <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt>, A <tt>TaskBarrier</tt> may be
 * repeatedly awaited. Each cycle has an associated value, returned
 * from <tt>arrive</tt>, that be used as an argument to
 * <tt>awaitCycleAdvance</tt>. Method <tt>arriveAndAwait</tt>
 * conveniently combines these. (In descriptions below, a task is
 * termed "active" unless it has arrived at a barrier but has not
 * advanced via <tt>awaitCycleAdvance</tt>, or has deregistered.)
 *
 * <li> TaskBarriers may enter a <em>termination</em> state in which
 * all await actions immediately return, indicating (via a negative
 * cycle value) that execution is complete. Termination is triggered
 * by executing the overridable <tt>terminate</tt> method that is
 * executed each time the barrier is tripped.
 *
 * <li> TaskBarriers may be used only by ForkJoinTasks.  Coordination
 * operations (<tt>arriveAndAwait</tt> and <tt>awaitCycleAdvance</tt>)
 * need not block, but instead help other tasks make progress.  While
 * not dynamically enforced, only registered tasks may invoke methods
 * <tt>arrive</tt>, <tt>arriveAndAwait</tt>, and
 * <tt>arriveAndDeregister</tt>. However any ForkJoinTask may invoke
 * <tt>awaitCycleAdvance</tt>. And any caller may invoke status
 * methods such as <tt>getParties</tt> for the sake of monitoring and
 * debugging.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> A TaskBarrier may be used to support a style of programming in
 * which a task waits for others to complete, without otherwise
 * needing to keep track of which tasks it is waiting for. This is
 * similar to the "sync" construct in Cilk and "clocks" in X10.
 * Special constructions based on such barriers are available using
 * the <tt>LinkedAsyncAction</tt> and <tt>CyclicAction</tt> classes, but
 * they can be useful in other contexts as well.  For a simple (but
 * not very useful) example, here is a variant of Fibonacci:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class BarrierFibonacci extends RecursiveAction {
 *   int argument, result;
 *   final TaskBarrier parentBarrier;
 *   BarrierFibonacci(int n, TaskBarrier parentBarrier) {
 *     this.argument = n;
 *     this.parentBarrier = parentBarrier;
 *     parentBarrier.register();
 *   }
 *   protected void compute() {
 *     int n = argument;
 *     if (n &lt;= 1)
 *        result = n;
 *     else {
 *        TaskBarrier childBarrier = new TaskBarrier(1);
 *        Fibonacci f1 = new Fibonacci(n - 1, childBarrier);
 *        Fibonacci f2 = new Fibonacci(n - 2, childBarrier);
 *        f1.fork();
 *        f2.fork();
 *        childBarrier.arriveAndAwait();
 *        result = f1.result + f2.result;
 *     }
 *     parentBarrier.arriveAndDeregister();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of registered parties to 65535. Attempts to register
 * additional parties result in IllegalStateExceptions.
