/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask}s, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute subtasks created by other active tasks (eventually blocking
 * waiting for work if none exist). This enables efficient processing
 * when most tasks spawn other subtasks (as do most {@code
 * ForkJoinTask}s). A {@code ForkJoinPool} may also be used for mixed
 * execution of some plain {@code Runnable}- or {@code Callable}-
 * based activities along with {@code ForkJoinTask}s. When setting
 * {@linkplain #setAsyncMode async mode}, a {@code ForkJoinPool} may
 * also be appropriate for use with fine-grained tasks of any form
 * that are never joined. Otherwise, other {@code ExecutorService}
 * implementations are typically more appropriate choices.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} is constructed with a given target
 * parallelism level; by default, equal to the number of available
 * processors. Unless configured otherwise via {@link
 * #setMaintainsParallelism}, the pool attempts to maintain this
 * number of active (or available) threads by dynamically adding,
 * suspending, or resuming internal worker threads, even if some tasks
 * are stalled waiting to join others. However, no such adjustments
 * are performed in the face of blocked IO or other unmanaged
 * synchronization. The nested {@link ManagedBlocker} interface
 * enables extension of the kinds of synchronization accommodated.
 * The target parallelism level may also be changed dynamically
 * ({@link #setParallelism}). The total number of threads may be
 * limited using method {@link #setMaximumPoolSize}, in which case it
 * may become possible for the activities of a pool to stall due to
 * the lack of available threads to process new tasks. When the pool
 * is executing tasks, these and other configuration setting methods
 * may only gradually affect actual pool sizes. It is normally best
 * practice to invoke these methods only when the pool is known to be
 * quiescent.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Normally a single {@code ForkJoinPool} is
 * used for all parallel task execution in a program or subsystem.
 * Otherwise, use would not usually outweigh the construction and
 * bookkeeping overhead of creating a large set of threads. For
 * example, a common pool could be used for the {@code SortTasks}
 * illustrated in {@link RecursiveAction}. Because {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} uses threads in {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#isDaemon
 * daemon} mode, there is typically no need to explicitly {@link
 * #shutdown} such a pool upon program exit.
 *
 * <pre>
 * static final ForkJoinPool mainPool = new ForkJoinPool();
 * ...
 * public void sort(long[] array) {
 *   mainPool.invoke(new SortTask(array, 0, array.length));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
 * pools with greater than the maximum number result in
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * <p>This implementation rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing
 * {@link RejectedExecutionException}) only when the pool is shut down.

    /*
     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class provides the central bookkeeping and control for a
     * set of worker threads: Submissions from non-FJ threads enter
     * into a submission queue. Workers take these tasks and typically
     * split them into subtasks that may be stolen by other workers.
     * The main work-stealing mechanics implemented in class
     * ForkJoinWorkerThread give first priority to processing tasks
     * from their own queues (LIFO or FIFO, depending on mode), then
     * to randomized FIFO steals of tasks in other worker queues, and
     * lastly to new submissions. These mechanics do not consider
     * affinities, loads, cache localities, etc, so rarely provide the
     * best possible performance on a given machine, but portably
     * provide good throughput by averaging over these factors.
     * (Further, even if we did try to use such information, we do not
     * usually have a basis for exploiting it. For example, some sets
     * of tasks profit from cache affinities, but others are harmed by
     * cache pollution effects.)
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly steal tasks from each
     * other. We do not want to negate this by creating bottlenecks
     * implementing the management responsibilities of this class. So
     * we use a collection of techniques that avoid, reduce, or cope
     * well with contention. These entail several instances of
     * bit-packing into CASable fields to maintain only the minimally
     * required atomicity. To enable such packing, we restrict maximum
     * parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (enabling twice this to fit into a 16
     * bit field), which is far in excess of normal operating range.
     * Even though updates to some of these bookkeeping fields do
     * sometimes contend with each other, they don't normally
     * cache-contend with updates to others enough to warrant memory
     * padding or isolation. So they are all held as fields of
     * ForkJoinPool objects.  The main capabilities are as follows:
     *
     * 1. Creating and removing workers. Workers are recorded in the
     * "workers" array. This is an array as opposed to some other data
     * structure to support index-based random steals by workers.
     * Updates to the array recording new workers and unrecording
     * terminated ones are protected from each other by a lock
     * (workerLock) but the array is otherwise concurrently readable,
     * and accessed directly by workers. To simplify index-based
     * operations, the array size is always a power of two, and all
     * readers must tolerate null slots. Currently, all but the first
     * worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task
     * submissions, replacement of terminated workers, and/or
     * compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support
     * code is set up to work with other policies.
     *
     * 2. Bookkeeping for dynamically adding and removing workers. We
     * maintain a given level of parallelism (or, if
     * maintainsParallelism is false, at least avoid starvation). When
     * some workers are known to be blocked (on joins or via
     * ManagedBlocker), we may create or resume others to take their
     * place until they unblock (see below). Implementing this
     * requires counts of the number of "running" threads (i.e., those
     * that are neither blocked nor artifically suspended) as well as
     * the total number.  These two values are packed into one field,
     * "workerCounts" because we need accurate snapshots when deciding
     * to create, resume or suspend.  To support these decisions,
     * updates must be prospective (not retrospective).  For example,
     * the running count is decremented before blocking by a thread
     * about to block, but incremented by the thread about to unblock
     * it. (In a few cases, these prospective updates may need to be
     * rolled back, for example when deciding to create a new worker
     * but the thread factory fails or returns null. In these cases,
     * we are no worse off wrt other decisions than we would be
     * otherwise.)  Updates to the workerCounts field sometimes
     * transiently encounter a fair amount of contention when join
     * dependencies are such that many threads block or unblock at
     * about the same time. We alleviate this by sometimes bundling
     * updates (for example blocking one thread on join and resuming a
     * spare cancel each other out), and in most other cases
     * performing an alternative action (like releasing waiters and
     * finding spares; see below) as a more productive form of
     * backoff.
     *
     * 3. Maintaining global run state. The run state of the pool
     * consists of a runLevel (SHUTDOWN, TERMINATING, etc) similar to
     * those in other Executor implementations, as well as a count of
     * "active" workers -- those that are, or soon will be, or
     * recently were executing tasks. The runLevel and active count
     * are packed together in order to correctly trigger shutdown and
     * termination. Without care, active counts can be subject to very
     * high contention.  We substantially reduce this contention by
     * relaxing update rules.  A worker must claim active status
     * prospectively, by activating if it sees that a submitted or
     * stealable task exists (it may find after activating that the
     * task no longer exists). It stays active while processing this
     * task (if it exists) and any other local subtasks it produces,
     * until it cannot find any other tasks. It then tries
     * inactivating (see method preStep), but upon update contention
     * instead scans for more tasks, later retrying inactivation if it
     * doesn't find any.
     *
     * 4. Managing idle workers waiting for tasks. We cannot let
     * workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when none are
     * available. On the other hand, we must quickly prod them into
     * action when new tasks are submitted or generated.  We
     * park/unpark these idle workers using an event-count scheme.
     * Field eventCount is incremented upon events that may enable
     * workers that previously could not find a task to now find one:
     * Submission of a new task to the pool, or another worker pushing
     * a task onto a previously empty queue.  (We also use this
     * mechanism for termination and reconfiguration actions that
     * require wakeups of idle workers).  Each worker maintains its
     * last known event count, and blocks when a scan for work did not
     * find a task AND its lastEventCount matches the current
     * eventCount. Waiting idle workers are recorded in a variant of
     * Treiber stack headed by field eventWaiters which, when nonzero,
     * encodes the thread index and count awaited for by the worker
     * thread most recently calling eventSync. This thread in turn has
     * a record (field nextEventWaiter) for the next waiting worker.
     * In addition to allowing simpler decisions about need for
     * wakeup, the event count bits in eventWaiters serve the role of
     * tags to avoid ABA errors in Treiber stacks.  To reduce delays
     * in task diffusion, workers not otherwise occupied may invoke
     * method releaseWaiters, that removes and signals (unparks)
     * workers not waiting on current count. To minimize task
     * production stalls associate with signalling, any worker pushing
     * a task on an empty queue invokes the weaker method signalWork,
     * that only releases idle workers until it detects interference
     * by other threads trying to release, and lets them take
     * over. The net effect is a tree-like diffusion of signals, where
     * released threads and possibly others) help with unparks.  To
     * further reduce contention effects a bit, failed CASes to
     * increment field eventCount are tolerated without retries.
     * Conceptually they are merged into the same event, which is OK
     * when their only purpose is to enable workers to scan for work.
     *
     * 5. Managing suspension of extra workers. When a worker is about
     * to block waiting for a join (or via ManagedBlockers), we may
     * create a new thread to maintain parallelism level, or at least
     * avoid starvation (see below). Usually, extra threads are needed
     * for only very short periods, yet join dependencies are such
     * that we sometimes need them in bursts. Rather than create new
     * threads each time this happens, we suspend no-longer-needed
     * extra ones as "spares". For most purposes, we don't distinguish
     * "extra" spare threads from normal "core" threads: On each call
     * to preStep (the only point at which we can do this) a worker
     * checks to see if there are now too many running workers, and if
     * so, suspends itself.  Methods preJoin and doBlock look for
     * suspended threads to resume before considering creating a new
     * replacement. We don't need a special data structure to maintain
     * spares; simply scanning the workers array looking for
     * worker.isSuspended() is fine because the calling thread is
     * otherwise not doing anything useful anyway; we are at least as
     * happy if after locating a spare, the caller doesn't actually
     * block because the join is ready before we try to adjust and
     * compensate.  Note that this is intrinsically racy.  One thread
     * may become a spare at about the same time as another is
     * needlessly being created. We counteract this and related slop
     * in part by requiring resumed spares to immediately recheck (in
     * preStep) to see whether they they should re-suspend. The only
     * effective difference between "extra" and "core" threads is that
     * we allow the "extra" ones to time out and die if they are not
     * resumed within a keep-alive interval of a few seconds. This is
     * implemented mainly within ForkJoinWorkerThread, but requires
     * some coordination (isTrimmed() -- meaning killed while
     * suspended) to correctly maintain pool counts.
     *
     * 6. Deciding when to create new workers. The main dynamic
     * control in this class is deciding when to create extra threads,
     * in methods preJoin and doBlock. We always need to create one
     * when the number of running threads becomes zero. But because
     * blocked joins are typically dependent, we don't necessarily
     * need or want one-to-one replacement. Using a one-to-one
     * compensation rule often leads to enough useless overhead
     * creating, suspending, resuming, and/or killing threads to
     * signficantly degrade throughput.  We use a rule reflecting the
     * idea that, the more spare threads you already have, the more
     * evidence you need to create another one; where "evidence" is
     * expressed as the current deficit -- target minus running
     * threads. To reduce flickering and drift around target values,
     * the relation is quadratic: adding a spare if (dc*dc)>=(sc*pc)
     * (where dc is deficit, sc is number of spare threads and pc is
     * target parallelism.)  This effectively reduces churn at the
     * price of systematically undershooting target parallelism when
     * many threads are blocked.  However, biasing toward undeshooting
     * partially compensates for the above mechanics to suspend extra
     * threads, that normally lead to overshoot because we can only
     * suspend workers in-between top-level actions. It also better
     * copes with the fact that some of the methods in this class tend
     * to never become compiled (but are interpreted), so some
     * components of the entire set of controls might execute many
     * times faster than others. And similarly for cases where the
     * apparent lack of work is just due to GC stalls and other
     * transient system activity.
     *
     * 7. Maintaining other configuration parameters and monitoring
     * statistics. Updates to fields controlling parallelism level,
     * max size, etc can only meaningfully take effect for individual
     * threads upon their next top-level actions; i.e., between
     * stealing/running tasks/submission, which are separated by calls
     * to preStep.  Memory ordering for these (assumed infrequent)
     * reconfiguration calls is ensured by using reads and writes to
     * volatile field workerCounts (that must be read in preStep anyway)
     * as "fences" -- user-level reads are preceded by reads of
     * workCounts, and writes are followed by no-op CAS to
     * workerCounts. The values reported by other management and
     * monitoring methods are either computed on demand, or are kept
     * in fields that are only updated when threads are otherwise
     * idle.
     *
     * Beware that there is a lot of representation-level coupling
     * among classes ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and
     * ForkJoinTask.  For example, direct access to "workers" array by
     * workers, and direct access to ForkJoinTask.status by both
     * ForkJoinPool and ForkJoinWorkerThread.  There is little point
     * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in
     * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic
     * changes anyway.
     *
     * Style notes: There are lots of inline assignments (of form
     * "while ((local = field) != 0)") which are usually the simplest
     * way to ensure read orderings. Also several occurrences of the
     * unusual "do {} while(!cas...)" which is the simplest way to
     * force an update of a CAS'ed variable. There are also a few
     * other coding oddities that help some methods perform reasonably
     * even when interpreted (not compiled).
     *
     * The order of declarations in this file is: (1) statics (2)
     * fields (along with constants used when unpacking some of them)
     * (3) internal control methods (4) callbacks and other support
     * for ForkJoinTask and ForkJoinWorkerThread classes, (5) exported
     * methods (plus a few little helpers).
