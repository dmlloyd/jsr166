/**
 * A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier CyclicBarrier} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch CountDownLatch}
 * but supporting more flexible usage.
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> The number of parties synchronizing on a phaser may vary over
 * time.  A task may register to be a party at any time, and may
 * deregister upon arriving at the barrier.  As is the case with most
 * basic synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration
 * affect only internal counts; they do not establish any further
 * internal bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are
 * registered. (However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by
 * subclassing this class.)
 *
 * <li> Each generation has an associated phase value, starting at
 * zero, and advancing when all parties reach the barrier (wrapping
 * around to zero after reaching {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}).
 *
 * <li> Like a CyclicBarrier, a Phaser may be repeatedly awaited.
 * Method {@code arriveAndAwaitAdvance} has effect analogous to
 * {@code CyclicBarrier.await}.  However, Phasers separate two
 * aspects of coordination, that may also be invoked independently:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li> Arriving at a barrier. Methods {@code arrive} and
 *       {@code arriveAndDeregister} do not block, but return
 *       the phase value current upon entry to the method.
 *
 *   <li> Awaiting others. Method {@code awaitAdvance} requires an
 *       argument indicating the entry phase, and returns when the
 *       barrier advances to a new phase.
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <li> Barrier actions, performed by the task triggering a phase
 * advance while others may be waiting, are arranged by overriding
 * method {@code onAdvance}, that also controls termination.
 * Overriding this method may be used to similar but more flexible
 * effect as providing a barrier action to a CyclicBarrier.
 *
 * <li> Phasers may enter a <em>termination</em> state in which all
 * actions immediately return without updating phaser state or waiting
 * for advance, and indicating (via a negative phase value) that
 * execution is complete.  Termination is triggered by executing the
 * overridable {@code onAdvance} method that is invoked each time the
 * barrier is about to be tripped. When a Phaser is controlling an
 * action with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient to
 * override this method to cause termination when the current phase
 * number reaches a threshold. Method {@code forceTermination} is also
 * available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them to
 * terminate.
 *
 * <li> Phasers may be tiered to reduce contention. Phasers with large
 * numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
 * synchronization contention costs may instead be arranged in trees.
 * This will typically greatly increase throughput even though it
 * incurs somewhat greater per-operation overhead.
 *
 * <li> By default, {@code awaitAdvance} continues to wait even if
 * the waiting thread is interrupted. And unlike the case in
 * CyclicBarriers, exceptions encountered while tasks wait
 * interruptibly or with timeout do not change the state of the
 * barrier. If necessary, you can perform any associated recovery
 * within handlers of those exceptions, often after invoking
 * {@code forceTermination}.
 *
 * <li>Phasers ensure lack of starvation when used by ForkJoinTasks.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages:</b>
 *
 * <p>A Phaser may be used instead of a {@code CountDownLatch} to control
 * a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties. The typical
 * idiom is for the method setting this up to first register, then
 * start the actions, then deregister, as in:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  void runTasks(List&lt;Runnable&gt; list) {
 *    final Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
 *    for (Runnable r : list) {
 *      phaser.register();
 *      new Thread() {
 *        public void run() {
 *          phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // await all creation
 *          r.run();
 *          phaser.arriveAndDeregister();   // signal completion
 *        }
 *      }.start();
 *   }
 *
 *   doSomethingOnBehalfOfWorkers();
 *   phaser.arrive(); // allow threads to start
 *   int p = phaser.arriveAndDeregister(); // deregister self  ...
 *   p = phaser.awaitAdvance(p); // ... and await arrival
 *   otherActions(); // do other things while tasks execute
 *   phaser.awaitAdvance(p); // await final completion
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
 * for a given number of iterations is to override {@code onAdvance}:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  void startTasks(List&lt;Runnable&gt; list, final int iterations) {
 *    final Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
 *       public boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
 *         return phase &gt;= iterations || registeredParties == 0;
 *       }
 *    };
 *    phaser.register();
 *    for (Runnable r : list) {
 *      phaser.register();
 *      new Thread() {
 *        public void run() {
 *           do {
 *             r.run();
 *             phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
 *           } while(!phaser.isTerminated();
 *        }
 *      }.start();
 *   }
 *   phaser.arriveAndDeregister(); // deregister self, don't wait
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p> To create a set of tasks using a tree of Phasers,
 * you could use code of the following form, assuming a
 * Task class with a constructor accepting a Phaser that
 * it registers for upon construction:
 * <pre>
 *  void build(Task[] actions, int lo, int hi, Phaser b) {
 *    int step = (hi - lo) / TASKS_PER_PHASER;
 *    if (step &gt; 1) {
 *       int i = lo;
 *       while (i &lt; hi) {
 *         int r = Math.min(i + step, hi);
 *         build(actions, i, r, new Phaser(b));
 *         i = r;
 *       }
 *    }
 *    else {
 *      for (int i = lo; i &lt; hi; ++i)
 *        actions[i] = new Task(b);
 *        // assumes new Task(b) performs b.register()
 *    }
 *  }
 *  // .. initially called, for n tasks via
 *  build(new Task[n], 0, n, new Phaser());
 * </pre>
 *
 * The best value of {@code TASKS_PER_PHASER} depends mainly on
 * expected barrier synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
 * be appropriate for extremely small per-barrier task bodies (thus
 * high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
 * parties result in IllegalStateExceptions. However, you can and
 * should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
 * of participants.
