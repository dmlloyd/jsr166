/**
 * A {@link SortedMap} extended with navigation methods returning the
 * closest matches for given search targets. Methods
 * <tt>lowerEntry</tt>, <tt>floorEntry</tt>, <tt>ceilingEntry</tt>,
 * and <tt>higherEntry</tt> return <tt>Map.Entry</tt> objects
 * associated with keys respectively less than, less than or equal,
 * greater than or equal, and greater than a given key, returning
 * <tt>null</tt> if there is no such key.  Similarly, methods
 * <tt>lowerKey</tt>, <tt>floorKey</tt>, <tt>ceilingKey</tt>, and
 * <tt>higherKey</tt> return only the associated keys. All of these
 * methods are designed for locating, not traversing entries.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>NavigableMap</tt> may be viewed and traversed in either
 * ascending or descending key order.  The <tt>Map</tt> methods
 * <tt>keySet</tt> and <tt>entrySet</tt> return ascending views, and
 * the additional methods <tt>descendingKeySet</tt> and
 * <tt>descendingEntrySet</tt> return descending views. The
 * performance of ascending traversals is likely to be faster than
 * descending traversals.  Notice that it is possible to perform
 * subrange traversals in either direction using <tt>navigableSubMap</tt>.
 * Methods <tt>navigableSubMap</tt>, <tt>navigableHeadMap</tt>, and
 * <tt>navigableTailMap</tt> differ from the similarly named
 * <tt>SortedMap</tt> methods only in their declared return types.
 * Submaps of any <tt>NavigableMap</tt> must obey
 * the <tt>NavigableMap</tt> interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface additionally defines methods <tt>firstEntry</tt>,
 * <tt>pollFirstEntry</tt>, <tt>lastEntry</tt>, and
 * <tt>pollLastEntry</tt> that return and/or remove the least and
 * greatest mappings, if any exist, else returning <tt>null</tt>.
 *
 * <p> Implementations of entry-returning methods are expected to
 * return <tt>Map.Entry</tt> pairs representing snapshots of mappings
 * at the time they were produced, and thus generally do <em>not</em>
 * support the optional <tt>Entry.setValue</tt> method. Note however
 * that it is possible to change mappings in the associated map using
 * method <tt>put</tt>.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
