    /*
     * Overview:
     *
     * ForkJoinWorkerThreads are managed by ForkJoinPools and perform
     * ForkJoinTasks. This class includes bookkeeping in support of
     * worker activation, suspension, and lifecycle control described
     * in more detail in the internal documentation of class
     * ForkJoinPool. And as described further below, this class also
     * includes special-cased support for some ForkJoinTask
     * methods. But the main mechanics involve work-stealing:
     *
     * Work-stealing queues are special forms of Deques that support
     * only three of the four possible end-operations -- push, pop,
     * and deq (aka steal), under the further constraints that push
     * and pop are called only from the owning thread, while deq may
     * be called from other threads.  (If you are unfamiliar with
     * them, you probably want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book "The
     * Art of Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these
     * in more detail before proceeding.)  The main work-stealing
     * queue design is roughly similar to those in the papers "Dynamic
     * Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005
     * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and
     * "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev,
     * PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186).
     * The main differences ultimately stem from gc requirements that
     * we null out taken slots as soon as we can, to maintain as small
     * a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge
     * numbers of tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS
     * arbitrating pop vs deq (steal) from being on the indices
     * ("base" and "sp") to the slots themselves (mainly via method
     * "casSlotNull()"). So, both a successful pop and deq mainly
     * entail a CAS of a slot from non-null to null.  Because we rely
     * on CASes of references, we do not need tag bits on base or sp.
     * They are simple ints as used in any circular array-based queue
     * (see for example ArrayDeque).  Updates to the indices must
     * still be ordered in a way that guarantees that sp == base means
     * the queue is empty, but otherwise may err on the side of
     * possibly making the queue appear nonempty when a push, pop, or
     * deq have not fully committed. Note that this means that the deq
     * operation, considered individually, is not wait-free. One thief
     * cannot successfully continue until another in-progress one (or,
     * if previously empty, a push) completes.  However, in the
     * aggregate, we ensure at least probabilistic non-blockingness.
     * If an attempted steal fails, a thief always chooses a different
     * random victim target to try next. So, in order for one thief to
     * progress, it suffices for any in-progress deq or new push on
     * any empty queue to complete. One reason this works well here is
     * that apparently-nonempty often means soon-to-be-stealable,
     * which gives threads a chance to set activation status if
     * necessary before stealing.
     *
     * This approach also enables support for "async mode" where local
     * task processing is in FIFO, not LIFO order; simply by using a
     * version of deq rather than pop when locallyFifo is true (as set
     * by the ForkJoinPool).  This allows use in message-passing
     * frameworks in which tasks are never joined.
     *
     * When a worker would otherwise be blocked waiting to join a
     * task, it first tries a form of linear helping: Each worker
     * records (in field currentSteal) the most recent task it stole
     * from some other worker. Plus, it records (in field currentJoin)
     * the task it is currently actively joining. Method joinTask uses
     * these markers to try to find a worker to help (i.e., steal back
     * a task from and execute it) that could hasten completion of the
     * actively joined task. In essence, the joiner executes a task
     * that would be on its own local deque had the to-be-joined task
     * not been stolen. This may be seen as a conservative variant of
     * the approach in Wagner & Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable
     * technique for implementing efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices,
     * 1993 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs
     * in that: (1) We only maintain dependency links across workers
     * upon steals, rather than use per-task bookkeeping.  This may
     * require a linear scan of workers array to locate stealers, but
     * usually doesn't because stealers leave hints (that may become
     * stale/wrong) of where to locate them. This isolates cost to
     * when it is needed, rather than adding to per-task overhead.
     * (2) It is "shallow", ignoring nesting and potentially cyclic
     * mutual steals.  (3) It is intentionally racy: field currentJoin
     * is updated only while actively joining, which means that we
     * miss links in the chain during long-lived tasks, GC stalls etc
     * (which is OK since blocking in such cases is usually a good
     * idea).  (4) We bound the number of attempts to find work (see
     * MAX_HELP_DEPTH) and fall back to suspending the worker and if
     * necessary replacing it with a spare (see
     * ForkJoinPool.awaitJoin).
     *
     * Efficient implementation of these algorithms currently relies
     * on an uncomfortable amount of "Unsafe" mechanics. To maintain
     * correct orderings, reads and writes of variable base require
     * volatile ordering.  Variable sp does not require volatile
     * writes but still needs store-ordering, which we accomplish by
     * pre-incrementing sp before filling the slot with an ordered
     * store.  (Pre-incrementing also enables backouts used in
     * joinTask.)  Because they are protected by volatile base reads,
     * reads of the queue array and its slots by other threads do not
     * need volatile load semantics, but writes (in push) require
     * store order and CASes (in pop and deq) require (volatile) CAS
     * semantics.  (Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev's algorithm has
     * similar properties, but without support for nulling slots.)
     * Since these combinations aren't supported using ordinary
     * volatiles, the only way to accomplish these efficiently is to
     * use direct Unsafe calls. (Using external AtomicIntegers and
     * AtomicReferenceArrays for the indices and array is
     * significantly slower because of memory locality and indirection
     * effects.)
     *
     * Further, performance on most platforms is very sensitive to
     * placement and sizing of the (resizable) queue array.  Even
     * though these queues don't usually become all that big, the
     * initial size must be large enough to counteract cache
     * contention effects across multiple queues (especially in the
     * presence of GC cardmarking). Also, to improve thread-locality,
     * queues are initialized after starting.  All together, these
     * low-level implementation choices produce as much as a factor of
     * 4 performance improvement compared to naive implementations,
     * and enable the processing of billions of tasks per second,
     * sometimes at the expense of ugliness.

    /**
     * Implements ForkJoinTask.getSurplusQueuedTaskCount().
     * Returns an estimate of the number of tasks, offset by a
     * function of number of idle workers.
     *
     * This method provides a cheap heuristic guide for task
     * partitioning when programmers, frameworks, tools, or languages
     * have little or no idea about task granularity.  In essence by
     * offering this method, we ask users only about tradeoffs in
     * overhead vs expected throughput and its variance, rather than
     * how finely to partition tasks.
     *
     * In a steady state strict (tree-structured) computation, each
     * thread makes available for stealing enough tasks for other
     * threads to remain active. Inductively, if all threads play by
     * the same rules, each thread should make available only a
     * constant number of tasks.
     *
     * The minimum useful constant is just 1. But using a value of 1
     * would require immediate replenishment upon each steal to
     * maintain enough tasks, which is infeasible.  Further,
     * partitionings/granularities of offered tasks should minimize
     * steal rates, which in general means that threads nearer the top
     * of computation tree should generate more than those nearer the
     * bottom. In perfect steady state, each thread is at
     * approximately the same level of computation tree. However,
     * producing extra tasks amortizes the uncertainty of progress and
     * diffusion assumptions.
     *
     * So, users will want to use values larger, but not much larger
     * than 1 to both smooth over transient shortages and hedge
     * against uneven progress; as traded off against the cost of
     * extra task overhead. We leave the user to pick a threshold
     * value to compare with the results of this call to guide
     * decisions, but recommend values such as 3.
     *
     * When all threads are active, it is on average OK to estimate
     * surplus strictly locally. In steady-state, if one thread is
     * maintaining say 2 surplus tasks, then so are others. So we can
     * just use estimated queue length (although note that (sp - base)
     * can be an overestimate because of stealers lagging increments
     * of base).  However, this strategy alone leads to serious
     * mis-estimates in some non-steady-state conditions (ramp-up,
     * ramp-down, other stalls). We can detect many of these by
     * further considering the number of "idle" threads, that are
     * known to have zero queued tasks, so compensate by a factor of
     * (#idle/#active) threads.
