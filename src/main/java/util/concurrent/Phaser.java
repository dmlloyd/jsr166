/**
 * A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier CyclicBarrier} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch CountDownLatch}
 * but supporting more flexible usage.
 *
 * <p> <b>Registration.</b> Unlike the case for other barriers, the
 * number of parties <em>registered</em> to synchronize on a phaser
 * may vary over time.  Tasks may be registered at any time (using
 * methods {@link #register}, {@link #bulkRegister}, or forms of
 * constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
 * optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using {@link
 * #arriveAndDeregister}).  As is the case with most basic
 * synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
 * only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
 * bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
 * (However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
 * class.)
 *
 * <p> <b>Synchronization.</b> Like a {@code CyclicBarrier}, a {@code
 * Phaser} may be repeatedly awaited.  Method {@link
 * #arriveAndAwaitAdvance} has effect analogous to {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier#await CyclicBarrier.await}. Each
 * generation of a {@code Phaser} has an associated phase number. The
 * phase number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive
 * at the barrier, wrapping around to zero after reaching {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}. The use of phase numbers enables independent
 * control of actions upon arrival at a barrier and upon awaiting
 * others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
 * registered party:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li> <b>Arrival.</b> Methods {@link #arrive} and
 *       {@link #arriveAndDeregister} record arrival at a
 *       barrier. These methods do not block, but return an associated
 *       <em>arrival phase number</em>; that is, the phase number of
 *       the barrier to which the arrival applied. When the final
 *       party for a given phase arrives, an optional barrier action
 *       is performed and the phase advances.  Barrier actions,
 *       performed by the party triggering a phase advance, are
 *       arranged by overriding method {@link #onAdvance(int, int)},
 *       which also controls termination. Overriding this method is
 *       similar to, but more flexible than, providing a barrier
 *       action to a {@code CyclicBarrier}.
 *
 *   <li> <b>Waiting.</b> Method {@link #awaitAdvance} requires an
 *       argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
 *       the barrier advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
 *       Unlike similar constructions using {@code CyclicBarrier},
 *       method {@code awaitAdvance} continues to wait even if the
 *       waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
 *       versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
 *       tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
 *       state of the barrier. If necessary, you can perform any
 *       associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
 *       often after invoking {@code forceTermination}.  Phasers may
 *       also be used by tasks executing in a {@link ForkJoinPool},
 *       which will ensure sufficient parallelism to execute tasks
 *       when others are blocked waiting for a phase to advance.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> <b>Termination.</b> A {@code Phaser} may enter a
 * <em>termination</em> state in which all synchronization methods
 * immediately return without updating phaser state or waiting for
 * advance, and indicating (via a negative phase value) that execution
 * is complete.  Termination is triggered when an invocation of {@code
 * onAdvance} returns {@code true}.  As illustrated below, when
 * phasers control actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is
 * often convenient to override this method to cause termination when
 * the current phase number reaches a threshold. Method {@link
 * #forceTermination} is also available to abruptly release waiting
 * threads and allow them to terminate.
 *
 * <p> <b>Tiering.</b> Phasers may be <em>tiered</em> (i.e., arranged
 * in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with large
 * numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
 * synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
 * groups of sub-phasers share a common parent.  This may greatly
 * increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
 * overhead.
 *
 * <p><b>Monitoring.</b> While synchronization methods may be invoked
 * only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
 * monitored by any caller.  At any given moment there are {@link
 * #getRegisteredParties} parties in total, of which {@link
 * #getArrivedParties} have arrived at the current phase ({@link
 * #getPhase}).  When the remaining ({@link #getUnarrivedParties})
 * parties arrive, the phase advances.  The values returned by these
 * methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
 * useful for synchronization control.  Method {@link #toString}
 * returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
 * informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages:</b>
 *
 * <p>A {@code Phaser} may be used instead of a {@code CountDownLatch}
 * to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
 * The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
 * register, then start the actions, then deregister, as in:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
 *   final Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
 *   // create and start threads
 *   for (Runnable task : tasks) {
 *     phaser.register();
 *     new Thread() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance(); // await all creation
 *         task.run();
 *       }
 *     }.start();
 *   }
 *
 *   // allow threads to start and deregister self
 *   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
 * for a given number of iterations is to override {@code onAdvance}:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, final int iterations) {
 *   final Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
 *     protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
 *       return phase >= iterations || registeredParties == 0;
 *     }
 *   };
 *   phaser.register();
 *   for (final Runnable task : tasks) {
 *     phaser.register();
 *     new Thread() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         do {
 *           task.run();
 *           phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
 *         } while (!phaser.isTerminated());
 *       }
 *     }.start();
 *   }
 *   phaser.arriveAndDeregister(); // deregister self, don't wait
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * If the main task must later await termination, it
 * may re-register and then execute a similar loop:
 *  <pre> {@code
 *   // ...
 *   phaser.register();
 *   while (!phaser.isTerminated())
 *     phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
 * in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around
 * {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}. For example:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
 *   int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
 *   while (p < phase) {
 *     if (phaser.isTerminated())
 *       // ... deal with unexpected termination
 *     else
 *       p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
 *   }
 *   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
 * }}</pre>
 *
 *
 * <p>To create a set of tasks using a tree of phasers,
 * you could use code of the following form, assuming a
 * Task class with a constructor accepting a phaser that
 * it registers with upon construction:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void build(Task[] actions, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
 *   if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
 *     for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
 *       int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
 *       build(actions, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
 *     }
 *   } else {
 *     for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
 *       actions[i] = new Task(ph);
 *       // assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
 *   }
 * }
 * // .. initially called, for n tasks via
 * build(new Task[n], 0, n, new Phaser());}</pre>
 *
 * The best value of {@code TASKS_PER_PHASER} depends mainly on
 * expected barrier synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
 * be appropriate for extremely small per-barrier task bodies (thus
 * high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
 * parties result in {@code IllegalStateException}. However, you can and
 * should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
 * of participants.
