/**
 * A counting semaphore.  Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
 * permits.  Each {@link #acquire} blocks if necessary until a permit is
 * available, and then takes it.  Each {@link #release} adds a permit,
 * potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
 * However, no actual permit objects are used; the <tt>Semaphore</tt> just
 * keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.
 *
 * <p>Semaphores are used to restrict the number of threads than can
 * access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
 * a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:
 * <pre>
 * class Pool {
 *   private static final MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
 *   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE);
 *
 *   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
 *     available.acquire();
 *     return getNextAvailableItem();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void putItem(Object x) {
 *     if (markAsUnused(x))
 *       available.release();
 *   }
 *
 *   // Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo
 *
 *   protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
 *   protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];
 *
 *   protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
 *       if (!used[i]) {
 *          used[i] = true;
 *          return items[i];
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return null; // not reached
 *   }
 *
 *   protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
 *       if (item == items[i]) {
 *          if (used[i]) {
 *            used[i] = false;
 *            return true;
 *          } else
 *            return false;
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return false;
 *   }
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from the
 * semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When the
 * thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the pool and
 * a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another thread to
 * acquire that item.
 * Note that no synchronization lock is held when {@link #acquire} is
 * called as that would prevent an item from being returned to the pool.
 * The semaphore encapsulates the synchronization needed to restrict access to
 * the pool, separately from any synchronization needed to maintain the
 * consistency of the pool itself.
 *
 * <p>A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it only
 * has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual exclusion lock.
 * This is more
 * commonly known as a <em>binary semaphore</em>, because it only has two
 * states: one permit available, or zero permits available.
 * When used in this way, the binary semaphore has the property (unlike many
 * {@link Lock} implementations, that the &quot;lock&quot; can be released by
 * a thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of ownership).
 * This can be useful in some specialised contexts, such as deadlock recovery.
 *
 * <p>This class makes no guarantees about the order in which threads
 * acquire permits. In particular, barging is permitted, that is, a thread
 * invoking {@link #acquire} can be allocated a permit ahead of a thread
 * that has been waiting. If you need more deterministic guarantees, consider
 * using {@link FairSemaphore}.
