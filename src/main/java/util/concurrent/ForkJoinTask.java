/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks that run within a {@link ForkJoinPool}.
 * A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a thread-like entity that is much
 * lighter weight than a normal thread.  Huge numbers of tasks and
 * subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
 * ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.
 *
 * <p>A "main" {@code ForkJoinTask} begins execution when submitted
 * to a {@link ForkJoinPool}.  Once started, it will usually in turn
 * start other subtasks.  As indicated by the name of this class,
 * many programs using {@code ForkJoinTask} employ only methods
 * {@link #fork} and {@link #join}, or derivatives such as {@link
 * #invokeAll(ForkJoinTask...) invokeAll}.  However, this class also
 * provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
 * advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow
 * support of new forms of fork/join processing.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a lightweight form of {@link Future}.
 * The efficiency of {@code ForkJoinTask}s stems from a set of
 * restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
 * reflecting their intended use as computational tasks calculating
 * pure functions or operating on purely isolated objects.  The
 * primary coordination mechanisms are {@link #fork}, that arranges
 * asynchronous execution, and {@link #join}, that doesn't proceed
 * until the task's result has been computed.  Computations should
 * avoid {@code synchronized} methods or blocks, and should minimize
 * other blocking synchronization apart from joining other tasks or
 * using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
 * cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Tasks should also not perform
 * blocking IO, and should ideally access variables that are
 * completely independent of those accessed by other running
 * tasks. Minor breaches of these restrictions, for example using
 * shared output streams, may be tolerable in practice, but frequent
 * use may result in poor performance, and the potential to
 * indefinitely stall if the number of threads not waiting for IO or
 * other external synchronization becomes exhausted. This usage
 * restriction is in part enforced by not permitting checked
 * exceptions such as {@code IOExceptions} to be thrown. However,
 * computations may still encounter unchecked exceptions, that are
 * rethrown to callers attempting to join them. These exceptions may
 * additionally include {@link RejectedExecutionException} stemming
 * from internal resource exhaustion, such as failure to allocate
 * internal task queues.
 *
 * <p>The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
 * results of a task is {@link #join}, but there are several variants:
 * The {@link Future#get} methods support interruptible and/or timed
 * waits for completion and report results using {@code Future}
 * conventions. Method {@link #invoke} is semantically
 * equivalent to {@code fork(); join()} but always attempts to begin
 * execution in the current thread. The "<em>quiet</em>" forms of
 * these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
 * may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
 * to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
 * Method {@code invokeAll} (available in multiple versions)
 * performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
 * of tasks and joining them all.
 *
 * <p>The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
 * of detail: {@link #isDone} is true if a task completed in any way
 * (including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);
 * {@link #isCompletedNormally} is true if a task completed without
 * cancellation or encountering an exception; {@link #isCancelled} is
 * true if the task was cancelled (in which case {@link #getException}
 * returns a {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}); and
 * {@link #isCompletedAbnormally} is true if a task was either
 * cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case {@link
 * #getException} will return either the encountered exception or
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}.
 *
 * <p>The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
 * Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
 * particular style of fork/join processing, typically {@link
 * RecursiveAction} for computations that do not return results, or
 * {@link RecursiveTask} for those that do.  Normally, a concrete
 * ForkJoinTask subclass declares fields comprising its parameters,
 * established in a constructor, and then defines a {@code compute}
 * method that somehow uses the control methods supplied by this base
 * class. While these methods have {@code public} access (to allow
 * instances of different task subclasses to call each other's
 * methods), some of them may only be called from within other
 * ForkJoinTasks (as may be determined using method {@link
 * #inForkJoinPool}).  Attempts to invoke them in other contexts
 * result in exceptions or errors, possibly including
 * {@code ClassCastException}.
 *
 * <p>Most base support methods are {@code final}, to prevent
 * overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
 * underlying lightweight task scheduling framework.  Developers
 * creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
 * implement {@code protected} methods {@link #exec}, {@link
 * #setRawResult}, and {@link #getRawResult}, while also introducing
 * an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
 * subclasses, possibly relying on other {@code protected} methods
 * provided by this class.
 *
 * <p>ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
 * computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
 * usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
 * a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
 * computational steps. If tasks are too big, then parallelism cannot
 * improve throughput. If too small, then memory and internal task
 * maintenance overhead may overwhelm processing.
 *
 * <p>This class provides {@code adapt} methods for {@link Runnable}
 * and {@link Callable}, that may be of use when mixing execution of
 * {@code ForkJoinTasks} with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
 * of this form, consider using a pool constructed in <em>asyncMode</em>.
 *
 * <p>ForkJoinTasks are {@code Serializable}, which enables them to be
 * used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
 * sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
 * execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

     * NORMAL, CANCELLED, or EXCEPTIONAL. Tasks undergoing blocking
     * waits by other threads have the SIGNAL bit set.  Completion of

     * notifyAll. Even though suboptimal for some purposes, we use
     * basic builtin wait/notify to take advantage of "monitor
     * inflation" in JVMs that we would otherwise need to emulate to
     * avoid adding further per-task bookkeeping overhead.  We want
     * these monitors to be "fat", i.e., not use biasing or thin-lock
