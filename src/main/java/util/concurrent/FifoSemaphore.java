/**
 * A semaphore that guarantees that threads invoking
 * any of the {@link #acquire() acquire} methods 
 * are allocated permits in the order in 
 * which their invocation of those methods was processed (first-in-first-out).
 *
 * <p>This class introduces a fairness guarantee that can be useful
 * in some contexts.
 * However, it needs to be realized that the order in which invocations are
 * processed can be different from the order in which an application perceives
 * those invocations to be processed. Effectively, when no permit is available
 * each thread is stored in a FIFO queue. As permits are released, they
 * are allocated to the thread at the head of the queue, and so the order
 * in which threads enter the queue, is the order in which they come out.  
 * This order need not have any relationship to the order in which requests 
 * were made, nor the order in which requests actually return to the caller as 
 * these depend on the underlying thread scheduling, which is not guaranteed 
 * to be predictable or fair.
 *
 * <p>As permits are allocated in-order, this class also provides convenience
 * methods to {@link #acquire(long) acquire} and 
 * {@link #release(long) release} multiple permits at a time.
