/**
 * An <tt>Exchanger</tt> provides a synchronization point at which two threads
 * can exchange objects.  Each thread presents some object on entry to
 * the {@link #exchange exchange} method, and receives the object presented by
 * the other thread on return.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage:</b>
 * Here are the highlights of a class that uses an <tt>Exchanger</tt> to
 * swap buffers between threads so that the thread filling the
 * buffer gets a freshly
 * emptied one when it needs it, handing off the filled one to
 * the thread emptying the buffer.
 * <pre>
 * class FillAndEmpty {
 *   Exchanger&lt;Buffer&gt; exchanger = new Exchanger();
 *   Buffer initialEmptyBuffer = ... a made-up type
 *   Buffer initialFullBuffer = ...
 *
 *   class FillingLoop implements Runnable {
 *     public void run() {
 *       Buffer currentBuffer = initialEmptyBuffer;
 *       try {
 *         while (currentBuffer != null) {
 *           addToBuffer(currentBuffer);
 *           if (currentBuffer.full())
 *             currentBuffer = exchanger.exchange(currentBuffer);
 *         }
 *       }
 *       catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ... }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   class EmptyingLoop implements Runnable {
 *     public void run() {
 *       Buffer currentBuffer = initialFullBuffer;
 *       try {
 *         while (currentBuffer != null) {
 *           takeFromBuffer(currentBuffer);
 *           if (currentBuffer.empty())
 *             currentBuffer = exchanger.exchange(currentBuffer);
 *         }
 *       }
 *       catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   void start() {
 *     new Thread(new FillingLoop()).start();
 *     new Thread(new EmptyingLoop()).start();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>

 * @fixme change example to use a bounded queue?
