/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 * one of possibly several pooled threads.
 *
 * <p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 * provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 * asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 * and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 * including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to ge highly tunable. 
 *
 * <p>To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 * provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks.  For
 * example, it can be configured to create a new thread for each task,
 * or even to execute tasks sequentially in a single thread, in
 * addition to its most common configuration, which reuses a pool of
 * threads.  However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 * factory methods <tt>newCachedThreadPool</tt> (unbounded thread
 * pool, with automatic thread reclamation),
 * <tt>newFixedThreadPool</tt> (fixed size thread pool),
 * <tt>newSingleThreadPoolExecutor</tt> (single background thread for
 * execution of tasks), and <tt>newThreadPerTaskExeceutor</tt>
 * (execute each task in a new thread), that preconfigure settings for
 * the most common usage scenarios.
 *
 * <p>Each <tt>ThreadPoolExecutor</tt> also maintains some basic
 * statistics, such as the number of completed tasks, that may be
 * useful for monitoring and tuning executors.
 *
 * <h3>Tuning guide</h3>
 * <dl>
 *
 * <dt>Core and maximum pool size</dt>
 *
 * <dd>A ThreadPoolExecutor will automatically adjust the pool size
 * according to the bounds set by corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize.
 * When a new task is submitted, and fewer than corePoolSize threads
 * are running, a new thread is created to handle the request, even if
 * other worker threads are idle.  If there are more than the
 * corePoolSize but less than maximumPoolSize threads running, a new
 * thread will be created only if the queue is full.  By setting
 * corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize the same, you create a fixed-size
 * thread pool. By default, even core threads are only created and
 * started when needed by new tasks, but this can be overridden
 * dynamically using method <tt>prestartCoreThread</tt>.
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Keep-alive</dt>
 *
 * <dd>The keepAliveTime determines what happens to idle threads.  If
 * the pool currently has more than the core number of threads, excess
 * threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more than the
 * keepAliveTime.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Queueing</dt>
 *
 * <dd>You are free to specify the queuing mechanism used to handle
 * submitted tasks.  A good default is to use a zero-capacity
 * <tt>SynchronousQueue</tt> to to hand off work to threads.  This is
 * a safe, conservative policy that avoids lockups when handling sets
 * of requests that might have internal dependencies.  Using an
 * unbounded queue (for example a <tt>LinkedBlockingQueue</tt>) will
 * cause new tasks to be queued in cases where all corePoolSize
 * threads are busy, so no more than corePoolSize threads will be
 * craated.  This may be appropriate when each task is completely
 * independent of others, so tasks cannot affect each others
 * execution. For example, in a web page server.  When given a choice,
 * this pool always prefers adding a new thread rather than queueing
 * if there are currently fewer than the current getCorePoolSize
 * threads running, but otherwise always prefers queuing a request
 * rather than adding a new thread.
 *
 * <p>While queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient bursts of
 * requests, especially in socket-based services, it is not very well
 * behaved when commands continue to arrive on average faster than
 * they can be processed.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes can
 * often be traded off for each other. Using large queues and small
 * pools minimizes CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching
 * overhead, but can lead to artifically low throughput.  If tasks
 * frequently block (for example if they are I/O bound), a system may
 * be able to schedule time for more threads than you otherwise
 * allow. Use of small queues or queueless handoffs generally requires
 * larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but may encounter
 * unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also decreases throughput.
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Creating new threads</dt>
 *
 * <dd>New threads are created using a ThreadFactory.  By default,
 * threads are created simply with the new Thread(Runnable)
 * constructor, but by supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 * alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 * etc.  </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Before and after intercepts</dt>
 *
 * <dd>This class has overridable methods that which are called before
 * and after execution of each task.  These can be used to manipulate
 * the execution environment (for example, reinitializing
 * ThreadLocals), gather statistics, or perform logging.  </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Rejected tasks</dt>
 *
 * <dd>There are a number of factors which can bound the number of
 * tasks which can execute at once, including the maximum pool size
 * and the queuing mechanism used.  If the executor determines that a
 * task cannot be executed because it has been refused by the queue
 * and no threads are available, or because the executor has been shut
 * down, the RejectedExecutionHandler's rejectedExecution method is
 * invoked. The default (<tt>AbortPolicy</tt>) handler throws a runtime
 * {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon rejection.  </dd>
 *
 * <dt>Termination</dt>
 *
 * <dd>ThreadPoolExecutor supports two shutdown options, immediate and
 * graceful.  In an immediate shutdown, any threads currently
 * executing are interrupted, and any tasks not yet begun are returned
 * from the shutdownNow call.  In a graceful shutdown, all queued
 * tasks are allowed to run, but new tasks may not be submitted.
