/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute subtasks created by other active tasks (eventually blocking
 * waiting for work if none exist). This enables efficient processing
 * when most tasks spawn other subtasks (as do most {@code
 * ForkJoinTask}s). When setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in
 * constructors, {@code ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use
 * with event-style tasks that are never joined.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} is constructed with a given target
 * parallelism level; by default, equal to the number of available
 * processors. The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or
 * available) threads by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming
 * internal worker threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to
 * join others. However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the
 * face of blocked IO or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested
 * {@link ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 * synchronization accommodated.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p> As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 * main task execution methods summarized in the following
 * table. These are designed to be used by clients not already engaged
 * in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main forms of
 * these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask}, but
 * overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally
 * <em>NOT</em> use these pool execution methods, but instead use the
 * within-computation forms listed in the table.

 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Normally a single {@code ForkJoinPool} is

 * example, a common pool could be used for the {@code SortTasks}
 * illustrated in {@link RecursiveAction}. Because {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} uses threads in {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#isDaemon
 * daemon} mode, there is typically no need to explicitly {@link
 * #shutdown} such a pool upon program exit.

 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
 * pools with greater than the maximum number result in

    /*
     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class provides the central bookkeeping and control for a
     * set of worker threads: Submissions from non-FJ threads enter
     * into a submission queue. Workers take these tasks and typically
     * split them into subtasks that may be stolen by other workers.
     * The main work-stealing mechanics implemented in class
     * ForkJoinWorkerThread give first priority to processing tasks
     * from their own queues (LIFO or FIFO, depending on mode), then
     * to randomized FIFO steals of tasks in other worker queues, and
     * lastly to new submissions. These mechanics do not consider
     * affinities, loads, cache localities, etc, so rarely provide the
     * best possible performance on a given machine, but portably
     * provide good throughput by averaging over these factors.
     * (Further, even if we did try to use such information, we do not
     * usually have a basis for exploiting it. For example, some sets
     * of tasks profit from cache affinities, but others are harmed by
     * cache pollution effects.)
     *
     * Beyond work-stealing support and essential bookkeeping, the
     * main responsibility of this framework is to take actions when
     * one worker is waiting to join a task stolen (or always held by)
     * another.  Because we are multiplexing many tasks on to a pool
     * of workers, we can't just let them block (as in Thread.join).
     * We also cannot just reassign the joiner's run-time stack with
     * another and replace it later, which would be a form of
     * "continuation", that even if possible is not necessarily a good
     * idea. Given that the creation costs of most threads on most
     * systems mainly surrounds setting up runtime stacks, thread
     * creation and switching is usually not much more expensive than
     * stack creation and switching, and is more flexible). Instead we
     * combine two tactics:
     *
     *   Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it
     *      would be running if the steal had not occurred.  Method
     *      ForkJoinWorkerThread.helpJoinTask tracks joining->stealing
     *      links to try to find such a task.
     *
     *   Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads,
     *      method helpMaintainParallelism() may create or
     *      re-activate a spare thread to compensate for blocked
     *      joiners until they unblock.
     *
     * It is impossible to keep exactly the target (parallelism)
     * number of threads running at any given time.  Determining
     * existence of conservatively safe helping targets, the
     * availability of already-created spares, and the apparent need
     * to create new spares are all racy and require heuristic
     * guidance, so we rely on multiple retries of each.  Compensation
     * occurs in slow-motion. It is triggered only upon timeouts of
     * Object.wait used for joins. This reduces poor decisions that
     * would otherwise be made when threads are waiting for others
     * that are stalled because of unrelated activities such as
     * garbage collection.
     *
     * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies
     * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker.
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly steal tasks from each
     * other. We do not want to negate this by creating bottlenecks
     * implementing other management responsibilities. So we use a
     * collection of techniques that avoid, reduce, or cope well with
     * contention. These entail several instances of bit-packing into
     * CASable fields to maintain only the minimally required
     * atomicity. To enable such packing, we restrict maximum
     * parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (enabling twice this (to accommodate
     * unbalanced increments and decrements) to fit into a 16 bit
     * field, which is far in excess of normal operating range.  Even
     * though updates to some of these bookkeeping fields do sometimes
     * contend with each other, they don't normally cache-contend with
     * updates to others enough to warrant memory padding or
     * isolation. So they are all held as fields of ForkJoinPool
     * objects.  The main capabilities are as follows:
     *
     * 1. Creating and removing workers. Workers are recorded in the
     * "workers" array. This is an array as opposed to some other data
     * structure to support index-based random steals by workers.
     * Updates to the array recording new workers and unrecording
     * terminated ones are protected from each other by a lock
     * (workerLock) but the array is otherwise concurrently readable,
     * and accessed directly by workers. To simplify index-based
     * operations, the array size is always a power of two, and all
     * readers must tolerate null slots. Currently, all worker thread
     * creation is on-demand, triggered by task submissions,
     * replacement of terminated workers, and/or compensation for
     * blocked workers. However, all other support code is set up to
     * work with other policies.
     *
     * To ensure that we do not hold on to worker references that
     * would prevent GC, ALL accesses to workers are via indices into
     * the workers array (which is one source of some of the unusual
     * code constructions here). In essence, the workers array serves
     * as a WeakReference mechanism. Thus for example the event queue
     * stores worker indices, not worker references. Access to the
     * workers in associated methods (for example releaseEventWaiters)
     * must both index-check and null-check the IDs. All such accesses
     * ignore bad IDs by returning out early from what they are doing,
     * since this can only be associated with shutdown, in which case
     * it is OK to give up. On termination, we just clobber these
     * data structures without trying to use them.
     *
     * 2. Bookkeeping for dynamically adding and removing workers. We
     * aim to approximately maintain the given level of parallelism.
     * When some workers are known to be blocked (on joins or via
     * ManagedBlocker), we may create or resume others to take their
     * place until they unblock (see below). Implementing this
     * requires counts of the number of "running" threads (i.e., those
     * that are neither blocked nor artificially suspended) as well as
     * the total number.  These two values are packed into one field,
     * "workerCounts" because we need accurate snapshots when deciding
     * to create, resume or suspend.  Note however that the
     * correspondence of these counts to reality is not guaranteed. In
     * particular updates for unblocked threads may lag until they
     * actually wake up.
     *
     * 3. Maintaining global run state. The run state of the pool
     * consists of a runLevel (SHUTDOWN, TERMINATING, etc) similar to
     * those in other Executor implementations, as well as a count of
     * "active" workers -- those that are, or soon will be, or
     * recently were executing tasks. The runLevel and active count
     * are packed together in order to correctly trigger shutdown and
     * termination. Without care, active counts can be subject to very
     * high contention.  We substantially reduce this contention by
     * relaxing update rules.  A worker must claim active status
     * prospectively, by activating if it sees that a submitted or
     * stealable task exists (it may find after activating that the
     * task no longer exists). It stays active while processing this
     * task (if it exists) and any other local subtasks it produces,
     * until it cannot find any other tasks. It then tries
     * inactivating (see method preStep), but upon update contention
     * instead scans for more tasks, later retrying inactivation if it
     * doesn't find any.
     *
     * 4. Managing idle workers waiting for tasks. We cannot let
     * workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when none are
     * available. On the other hand, we must quickly prod them into
     * action when new tasks are submitted or generated.  We
     * park/unpark these idle workers using an event-count scheme.
     * Field eventCount is incremented upon events that may enable
     * workers that previously could not find a task to now find one:
     * Submission of a new task to the pool, or another worker pushing
     * a task onto a previously empty queue.  (We also use this
     * mechanism for configuration and termination actions that
     * require wakeups of idle workers).  Each worker maintains its
     * last known event count, and blocks when a scan for work did not
     * find a task AND its lastEventCount matches the current
     * eventCount. Waiting idle workers are recorded in a variant of
     * Treiber stack headed by field eventWaiters which, when nonzero,
     * encodes the thread index and count awaited for by the worker
     * thread most recently calling eventSync. This thread in turn has
     * a record (field nextEventWaiter) for the next waiting worker.
     * In addition to allowing simpler decisions about need for
     * wakeup, the event count bits in eventWaiters serve the role of
     * tags to avoid ABA errors in Treiber stacks. Upon any wakeup,
     * released threads also try to release at most two others.  The
     * net effect is a tree-like diffusion of signals, where released
     * threads (and possibly others) help with unparks.  To further
     * reduce contention effects a bit, failed CASes to increment
     * field eventCount are tolerated without retries in signalWork.
     * Conceptually they are merged into the same event, which is OK
     * when their only purpose is to enable workers to scan for work.
     *
     * 5. Managing suspension of extra workers. When a worker notices
     * (usually upon timeout of a wait()) that there are too few
     * running threads, we may create a new thread to maintain
     * parallelism level, or at least avoid starvation. Usually, extra
     * threads are needed for only very short periods, yet join
     * dependencies are such that we sometimes need them in
     * bursts. Rather than create new threads each time this happens,
     * we suspend no-longer-needed extra ones as "spares". For most
     * purposes, we don't distinguish "extra" spare threads from
     * normal "core" threads: On each call to preStep (the only point
     * at which we can do this) a worker checks to see if there are
     * now too many running workers, and if so, suspends itself.
     * Method helpMaintainParallelism looks for suspended threads to
     * resume before considering creating a new replacement. The
     * spares themselves are encoded on another variant of a Treiber
     * Stack, headed at field "spareWaiters".  Note that the use of
     * spares is intrinsically racy.  One thread may become a spare at
     * about the same time as another is needlessly being created. We
     * counteract this and related slop in part by requiring resumed
     * spares to immediately recheck (in preStep) to see whether they
     * should re-suspend.
     *
     * 6. Killing off unneeded workers. A timeout mechanism is used to
     * shed unused workers: The oldest (first) event queue waiter uses
     * a timed rather than hard wait. When this wait times out without
     * a normal wakeup, it tries to shutdown any one (for convenience
     * the newest) other spare or event waiter via
     * tryShutdownUnusedWorker. This eventually reduces the number of
     * worker threads to a minimum of one after a long enough period
     * without use.
     *
     * 7. Deciding when to create new workers. The main dynamic
     * control in this class is deciding when to create extra threads
     * in method helpMaintainParallelism. We would like to keep
     * exactly #parallelism threads running, which is an impossible
     * task. We always need to create one when the number of running
     * threads would become zero and all workers are busy. Beyond
     * this, we must rely on heuristics that work well in the
     * presence of transient phenomena such as GC stalls, dynamic
     * compilation, and wake-up lags. These transients are extremely
     * common -- we are normally trying to fully saturate the CPUs on
     * a machine, so almost any activity other than running tasks
     * impedes accuracy. Our main defense is to allow parallelism to
     * lapse for a while during joins, and use a timeout to see if,
     * after the resulting settling, there is still a need for
     * additional workers.  This also better copes with the fact that
     * some of the methods in this class tend to never become compiled
     * (but are interpreted), so some components of the entire set of
     * controls might execute 100 times faster than others. And
     * similarly for cases where the apparent lack of work is just due
     * to GC stalls and other transient system activity.
     *
     * Beware that there is a lot of representation-level coupling
     * among classes ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and
     * ForkJoinTask.  For example, direct access to "workers" array by
     * workers, and direct access to ForkJoinTask.status by both
     * ForkJoinPool and ForkJoinWorkerThread.  There is little point
     * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in
     * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic
     * changes anyway.
     *
     * Style notes: There are lots of inline assignments (of form
     * "while ((local = field) != 0)") which are usually the simplest
     * way to ensure the required read orderings (which are sometimes
     * critical). Also several occurrences of the unusual "do {}
     * while (!cas...)" which is the simplest way to force an update of
     * a CAS'ed variable. There are also other coding oddities that
     * help some methods perform reasonably even when interpreted (not
     * compiled), at the expense of some messy constructions that
     * reduce byte code counts.
     *
     * The order of declarations in this file is: (1) statics (2)
     * fields (along with constants used when unpacking some of them)
     * (3) internal control methods (4) callbacks and other support
     * for ForkJoinTask and ForkJoinWorkerThread classes, (5) exported
     * methods (plus a few little helpers).

     * <p>A {@code ManagedBlocker} provides two methods.  Method
     * {@code isReleasable} must return {@code true} if blocking is
     * not necessary. Method {@code block} blocks the current thread
     * if necessary (perhaps internally invoking {@code isReleasable}
     * before actually blocking). The unusual methods in this API
     * accommodate synchronizers that may, but don't usually, block
     * for long periods. Similarly, they allow more efficient internal
     * handling of cases in which additional workers may be, but
     * usually are not, needed to ensure sufficient parallelism.
     * Toward this end, implementations of method {@code isReleasable}
     * must be amenable to repeated invocation.
     *
     * <p>For example, here is a ManagedBlocker based on a
     * ReentrantLock:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class ManagedLocker implements ManagedBlocker {

     *     return hasLock || (hasLock = lock.tryLock());
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>Here is a class that possibly blocks waiting for an
     * item on a given queue:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class QueueTaker<E> implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final BlockingQueue<E> queue;
     *   volatile E item = null;

     *   public boolean block() throws InterruptedException {
