/**
 * A {@link java.util.Queue} that additionally supports operations
 * that wait for elements to exist when retrieving them, and wait for
 * space to exist when putting them.
 *
 * <p> <tt>BlockingQueues</tt> do not accept <tt>null</tt> elements.
 * Implementations throw <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt> on attempts
 * to <tt>add</tt>, <tt>put</tt> or <tt>offer</tt> a <tt>null</tt>.  A
 * <tt>null</tt> is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
 * <tt>poll</tt> operations.
 *
 * <p><tt>BlockingQueues</tt> may be capacity bounded. At any given
 * time they may have a <tt>remainingCapacity</tt> beyond which no
 * additional elements can be <tt>put</tt> without blocking.
 * BlockingQueues without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
 * report a remaining capacity of <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt>.
 *
 * <p> While <tt>BlockingQueues</tt> are designed to be used primarily
 * as producer-consumer queues, they additionally support the
 * <tt>Collection</tt> interface.  So, for example, it is possible to
 * remove an arbitrary element from within a queue using
 * <tt>remove(x)</tt>. However, such operations are in general
 * <em>NOT</em> performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
 * occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.  Also,
 * the bulk operations, most notably <tt>addAll</tt> are <em>NOT</em>
 * performed atomically, so it is possible for <tt>addAll(c)</tt> to
 * fail (throwing an exception) after adding only some of the elements
 * in <tt>c</tt>.
 *
 * <p><tt>BlockingQueue</tt>s do <em>not</em> intrinsically support
 * any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to
 * indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
 * such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
 * common tactic is for producers to insert special
 * <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are
 * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
 * Note that Blocking queues can safely be used with multiple producers
 * and multiple consumers.
