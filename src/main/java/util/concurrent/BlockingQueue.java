/**
 * A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> is a {@link java.util.Queue} that additionally 
 * supports
 * operations that wait for elements to exist when taking them, and/or
 * wait for space to exist when putting them.
 *
 * <p><tt>BlockingQueue</tt> implementations might or might not have bounded
 * capacity or other insertion constraints, so in general, you cannot
 * tell if a given <tt>put</tt> will block.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>BlockingQueue</tt> should not accept <tt>null</tt> elements as
 * <tt>null</tt> is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
 * <tt>poll</tt> operations. If it necessary to allow <tt>null</tt> as an
 * element then it is the responsibility of the client code to deal with
 * this ambiguity. It is preferable to use a special object to represent 
 * &quot;no element&quot; rather than using the value <tt>null</tt>.
 * <p>
 * Usage example. Here is a sketch of a classic producer-consumer program.
 * <pre>
 * class Producer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while(true) { queue.put(produce()); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   Object produce() { ... }
 * }
 *
 *
 * class Consumer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Concumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while(true) { consume(queue.take()); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   void consume(Object x) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Setup {
 *   void main() {
 *     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
 *     Producer p = new Producer(q);
 *     Consumer c = new Consumer(q);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 *     new Thread(c).start();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><tt>BlockingQueue</tt>s do <em>not</em> intrinsically support any kind 
 * of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to indicate that 
 * no more items will be added. 
 * The needs and usage of such features tend to be implementation
 * dependent. For example, a common tactic is for producers to insert
 * special <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are 
 * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
