/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows a set threads to all wait for
 * each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
 * useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
 * must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
 * <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
 * are released.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt> supports an optional {@link Runnable} command
 * that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party
 * arrives, but before any threads are released. 
 * This <em>barrier action</em> is useful
 * for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.
 * 
 * <p><b>Sample usage:</b> Here is an example of
 *  using a barrier in a parallel decomposition design:
 * <pre>
 * class Solver {
 *   final int N;
 *   final float[][] data;
 *   final CyclicBarrier barrier;
 *   
 *   class Worker implements Runnable {
 *     int myRow;
 *     Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
 *     public void run() {
 *       while (!done()) {
 *         processRow(myRow);
 *
 *         try {
 *           barrier.await(); 
 *         }
 *         catch (InterruptedException ex) { return; }
 *         catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) { return; }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
 *     data = matrix;
 *     N = matrix.length;
 *     barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N, 
 *                                 new Runnable() {
 *                                   public void run() { 
 *                                     mergeRows(...); 
 *                                   }
 *                                 });
 *     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) 
 *       new Thread(new Worker(i)).start();
 *
 *     waitUntilDone();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the 
 * barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed
 * the supplied {@link Runnable} barrier action is executed and merges the 
 * rows. If the merger
 * determines that a solution has been found then <tt>done()</tt> will return
 * <tt>true</tt> and each worker will terminate.
 *
 * <p>If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
 * it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
 * action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of
 * {@link #await} returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
 * You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for 
 * example:
 * <pre>  if (barrier.await() == 0) {
 *     // log the completion of this iteration
 *   }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt> uses an all-or-none breakage model
 * for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
 * point prematurely because of interruption or timeout, all others
 * will also leave abnormally (via {@link BrokenBarrierException}),
 * until the barrier is {@link #reset}. This is usually the simplest
 * and best strategy for sharing knowledge about failures among
 * cooperating threads in the most common usage contexts of barriers.
