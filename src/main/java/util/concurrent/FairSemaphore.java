/**
 * A semaphore guaranteeing that threads invoking any of the {@link
 * #acquire() acquire} methods are allocated permits in the order in
 * which their invocation of those methods was processed
 * (first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
 * applies to specific internal points of execution within these
 * methods.  So, it is possible for one thread to invoke
 * <tt>acquire</tt> before another, but reach the ordering point after
 * the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
 *
 * <p>Because permits are allocated in-order, this class also provides
 * convenience methods to {@link #acquire(long) acquire} and {@link
 * #release(long) release} multiple permits at a time.
