/**
 * <tt>Lock</tt> implementations provide more flexible locking operations than
 * can be obtained using <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements.
 *
 * <p>A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared
 * resource by multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access
 * to a shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the
 * lock and all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
 * acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to a shared
 * resource, such as the read lock of a {@link ReadWriteLock}.
 *
 * <p>The use of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods or statements provides 
 * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
 * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
 * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
 * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
 * they were acquired.
 *
 * <p>While the scoping mechanism for <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and 
 * statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
 * and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks, there are
 * rare occasions where you need to work with locks in a more flexible way. For
 * example, some advanced algorithms for traversing concurrently accessed data
 * structures require the use of what is called &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; or 
 * &quot;chain locking&quot;: you acquire the lock of node A, then node B, 
 * then release A and acquire C, then release B and acquire D and so on. 
 * Implementations of the <tt>Lock</tt> interface facilitate the use of such 
 * advanced algorithms by allowing a lock to be acquired and released in 
 * different scopes, and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released 
 * in any order. 
 *
 * <p>With this increased flexibilty comes
 * additional responsibility as the absence of block-structured locking
 * removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with 
 * <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements. For the simplest usage
 * the following idiom should be used:
 * <pre><tt>     Lock l = ...; 
 *     l.lock();
 *     try {
 *         // access the resource protected by this lock
 *     } finally {
 *         l.unlock();
 *     }
 * </tt></pre>
 *
 * <p><tt>Lock</tt> implementations provide additional functionality over the 
 * use
 * of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements by providing a non-blocking
 * attempt to acquire a lock ({@link #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the
 * lock that can be interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt
 * to acquire the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, TimeUnit)}).
 * This additional functionality is also extended to built-in monitor
 * locks through the methods of the {@link Locks} utility class.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Lock</tt> class can also provide behavior and semantics that is 
 * quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock, such as guaranteed 
 * ordering,
 * non-reentrant usage, or deadlock detection. If an implementation provides
 * such specialised semantics then the implementation must document those
 * semantics.
 *
 * <p>Note that <tt>Lock</tt> instances are just normal objects and can 
 * themselves be used as the target in a <tt>synchronized</tt> statement.
 * Acquiring the
 * monitor lock of a <tt>Lock</tt> instance has no specified relationship
 * with invoking any of the {@link #lock} methods of that instance. 
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use <tt>Lock</tt>
 * instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> value for any parameter 
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Memory Synchronization</h3>
 * <p>All <tt>Lock</tt> implementations <em>must</em> enforce the same
 * memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A successful lock operation acts like a successful 
 * <tt>monitorEnter</tt> action
 * <li>A successful <tt>unlock</tt> operation acts like a successful
 * <tt>monitorExit</tt> action
 * </ul>
 * Note that unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
 * locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory synchronization
 * effects.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
 * <p>It is recognised that the three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
 * non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their ease of implementation
 * on some platforms and in their performance characteristics.
 * In particular, it may be difficult to provide these features and maintain 
 * specific semantics such as ordering guarantees. 
 * Further, the ability to interrupt the acquisition of a lock may not always
 * be feasible to implement on all platforms.
 * <p>Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the 
 * same 
 * guarantees or semantics for all three forms of lock acquistion, nor is it 
 * required to support interruption of the actual lock acquisition.
 * An implementation is required to clearly
 * document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the locking 
 * methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as defined in this
 * interface, to the extent that interruption of lock acquisition is 
 * supported: which is either totally, or only on method entry.
 * <p>As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for 
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. An implementation should document this behaviour.
