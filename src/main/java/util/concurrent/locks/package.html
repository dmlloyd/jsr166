This package provides a framework for locking and waiting for
conditions that is distinct from built-in synchronization and
monitors. The framework permits much greater flexibility in the use
of locks and conditions, at the expense of more awkward syntax.

<p> To be continued.

<p>
The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock} interface supports locking
disciplines that differ in semantics (reentrant, fair, etc), and that
can be used in non-block-structured contexts including hand-over-hand
and lock reordering algorithms. The main implementation is {@link
java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}.

<p> The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock} interface
similarly defines locks that may be shared among readers but are
exclusive to writers.  Only a single implementation, {@link
java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock}, is provided, since
it covers all standard usage contexts. But programmers may create
their own implementations to cover nonstandard requirements.

<p> The {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} interface
describes the kinds of condition variables associated with monitors in
other concurrent languages, as well as pthreads-style condvars.  Their
support reduces the need for tricky and/or inefficient solutions to
many classic concurrent problems.  To avoid compatibility problems,
the names of Condition methods are different than Object versions.
