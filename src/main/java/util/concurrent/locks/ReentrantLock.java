/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed by the
 * use of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements, but without
 * the forced block-structured locking and unlocking that occurs with
 * <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements.
 *
 * <p> The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set <tt>true</tt>, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise a policy is used that does not guarantee any
 * particular access order.  Programs using fair locks may display
 * lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much slower) than
 * those using default locks, but have but smaller variances in times
 * to obtain locks and guarantee lack of starvation.
 *
 * <p>If you want a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock then it is a simple
 * matter to use a reentrant lock in a non-reentrant way by ensuring that
 * the lock is not held by the current thread prior to locking.
 * See {@link #getHoldCount} for a way to check this.
 *
 *
 * <p><tt>ReentrantLock</tt> instances are intended to be used primarily
 * in before/after constructions such as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class X {
 *   ReentrantLock lock;
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> value for any parameter
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 * <p>This implementation supports the interruption of lock acquisition and
 * provides a
 * {@link #newCondition Condition} implementation that supports the
 * interruption of thread suspension.
 * It also favors interruption over normal method return.

public class ReentrantLock implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {
    /*
      The basic fastpath/slowpath algorithm looks like this, ignoring
      reentrance, cancellation, timeouts, error checking etc:
        Lock:
          if (!fair && casOwner(null, currentThread)) // fastpath
            return;
          node = create and enq a wait node;
          for (;;) {
            if (node is first on queue) {
              if (casOwner(null, currentThread)) {
                 deq(node);
                 return;
               }
            }
            park(currentThread);
          }

        Unlock:
          owner = null;      // volatile assignment
          h = first node on queue;
          if (h != null) unpark(h's successor's thread);

      * The fast path uses one atomic CAS operation, plus one
        StoreLoad barrier (i.e., volatile-write-barrier) per
        lock/unlock pair.  The "owner" field is handled as a simple
        spinlock.  To lock, the owner field is set to current thread
        using conditional atomic update.  To unlock, the owner field
        is set to null, checking if anyone needs waking up, if so
        doing so.  Recursive locks/unlocks instead increment/decrement
        recursion field.

      * By default, contended locks use a kind of "greedy" /
        "renouncement" / barging / convoy-avoidance strategy: When a
        lock is released, a waiting thread is signalled so that it can
        (re)contend for the lock. It might lose and thus need to
        rewait. This strategy has much higher throughput than
        "directed handoff" because it reduces blocking of running
        threads, but poorer fairness.  The wait queue is FIFO, but
        newly entering threads can barge ahead and grab lock before
        woken waiters, so acquires are not strictly FIFO, and transfer
        is not deterministically fair. It is probablistically fair
        though. Earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before
        later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased
        chance to succeed.

      * The "fair" variant differs only in that barging is disabled
        when there is contention, so locks proceed FIFO. There can be
        some races in detecting contention, but it is still FIFO from
        a definable (although complicated to describe) single point,
        so qualifies as a FIFO lock.

      * The wait queue is a variant of a "CLH" (Craig, Landin, and
        Hagersten) lock. CLH locks are normally used for spinlocks.
        We instead use them for blocking locks, but use the same basic
        tactic of holding the information about whether a thread is
        released (i.e, eligible to contend for ownership lock) in the
        predecessor of each node.  A node waits until its predecessor
        says it is released. It is signalled when its predecessor
        releases the lock. Each node of the queue otherwise serves as
        a specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
        thread.

        To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
        tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.

             +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
        head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
             +------+       +-----+       +-----+

        The great thing about CLH Locks is that insertion into a CLH
        queue requires only a single atomic operation on "tail", so
        there is a simple atomic point of demarcation from unqueued to
        queued. Similarly, dequeing involves only updating the
        "head". However, it takes a bit more work for nodes to
        determine who their successors are, in part to deal with
        possible cancellation due to timeouts and interrupts.

        The "prev" links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
        needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
        successor must be relinked to a non-cancelled predecessor. For
        explanation in the case of spin locks, see the papers by Scott
        & Scherer at
        http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/

        Being first in the queue does not mean that you have the lock,
        only that you may contend for it (by CAS'ing owner field).  So
        the currently released contender thread may need to rewait.

        We also use "next" links to implement blocking mechanics.  The
        thread id for each node is kept in its node, so a predecessor
        signals the next node to wake up by traversing next link to
        determine which thread it is.  Determination of successor must
        avoid races with newly queued nodes to set the "next" fields
        of their predecessors.  This is solved by checking backwards
        from the atomically updated "tail" when a node's successor
        appears to be null.

        Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
        algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
        nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is ahead
        or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
        successors upon cancellation, and not letting them park again
        (by saturating release counts) until they stabilize on a new
        predecessor.

      * Threads waiting on Conditions use the same kind of nodes, but
        only need to link them in simple (non-concurrent) linked
        queues because they are only accessed when lock is held.  To
        wait, a thread makes a node inserted into a condition queue.
        Upon signal, the node is transferred to the lock queue.
        Special values of releaseStatus fields are used to mark which
        queue a node is on.

      * All suspension and resumption of threads uses the internal
        JSR166 native park/unpark API. These are safe versions of
        suspend/resume (plus timeout support) that avoid the intrinsic
        race problems with suspend/resume: Park suspends if not
        preceded by an unpark. Unpark resumes if waiting, else causes
        next park not to suspend. While safe and efficient, these are
        not general-purpose public operations because we cannot allow
        code outside this package to randomly call these methods --
        parks and unparks should be matched up. (It is OK to have more
        unparks than unparks, but it causes threads to spuriously wake
        up. So minimizing excessive unparks is a performance concern.)
