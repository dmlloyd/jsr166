/**
 * An unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap.  This queue orders
 * elements according to the order specified at creation time.  This order is
 * specified as for {@link TreeSet} and {@link TreeMap}: Elements are ordered
 * either according to their <i>natural order</i> (see {@link Comparable}), or
 * according to a {@link Comparator}, depending on which constructor is used.
 * The {@link #peek}, {@link #poll}, and {@link #remove} methods return the
 * minimal element with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple
 * these elements are tied for least value, no guarantees are made as to
 * which of elements is returned.
 *
 * <p>Each priority queue has a <i>capacity</i>.  The capacity is the size of
 * the array used to store the elements on the queue.  It is always at least
 * as large as the queue size.  As elements are added to a priority list,
 * its capacity grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 * specified.
 *
 *<p>Implementation note: this implementation provides O(log(n)) time for
 * the <tt>offer</tt>, <tt>poll</tt>, <tt>remove()</tt> and <tt>add</tt>
 * methods; linear time for the <tt>remove(Object)</tt> and
