/**
 * A <tt>Lock</tt> provides more flexible locking operations than
 * can be obtained using <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Lock</tt> is a tool for controlling access to a shared
 * resource by multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access
 * to a shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the
 * lock and all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
 * acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to a shared
 * resource, such as the read lock of a {@link ReadWriteLock}.
 *
 * <p>The use of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods or statements provides 
 * access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
 * forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
 * when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
 * order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
 * they were acquired.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Lock</tt> can be acquired and released in different scopes, and
 * multiple locks can be acquired and released in any order. This flexibility
 * is essential for implementing efficient algorithms for the concurrent
 * access of some data structures. But with this increased flexibilty comes
 * additional responsibility as the absence of block-structured locking
 * removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with 
 * <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and statements. For the simplest usage
 * the following idiom should be used:
 * <pre><tt>     Lock l = ...; 
 *     l.lock();
 *     try {
 *         // access the resource protected by this lock
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *         l.unlock();
 *     }
 * </tt></pre>
 * <p>A <tt>Lock</tt> also provides additional functionality over the use
 * of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and blocks by providing a non-blocking
 * attempt to acquire a lock ({@link #tryLock()}), an attempt to acquire the
 * lock that can be interrupted ({@link #lockInterruptibly}, and an attempt
 * to acquire the lock that can timeout ({@link #tryLock(long, Clock)}).
 * A <tt>Lock</tt> can also provide behaviour and semantics that is quite
 * different to that of the implicit monitor lock.
