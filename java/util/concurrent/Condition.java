/**
 * <tt>Conditions</tt> abstract out the <tt>Object</tt> monitor 
 * methods ({@link Object#wait() wait}, {@link Object#notify notify} and
 * {@link Object#notifyAll notifyAll}) into distinct objects that can be bound 
 * to other objects to give the effect of having multiple wait-sets per
 * object monitor. They also generalise the monitor methods to allow them to 
 * be used with arbitrary {@link Lock} implementations when needed.
 *
 * <p>Conditions (also known as condition queues or condition variables) 
 * provide
 * a means for one thread to suspend execution (to &quot;wait&quot;) until
 * notified by another thread that some state-condition the first thread is 
 * waiting for may now be true. Because access to this shared state information
 * occurs in different threads, it must be protected and invariably
 * a lock, of some form, is always associated with the condition. The key
 * property that waiting for a condition provides is that it 
 * <em>atomically</em> releases the associated lock and suspends the current
 * thread. 
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Condition</tt> is intrinsically bound to a lock: either a
 * the in-built monitor lock of an object, or a {@link Lock} instance.
 * To obtain a <tt>Condition</tt> for a particular object's monitor lock
 * use the {@link Locks#newConditionFor(Object)} method.
 * To obtain a <tt>Condition</tt> for a particular {@link Lock} use its
 * {@link Lock#newCondition} method.
 *
 * <p>A <tt>Condition</tt> can provide behaviour and semantics that is 
 * different to that of the <tt>Object</tt> monitor methods, such as 
 * guaranteed ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held 
 * when performing notifications.
 * If an implementation provides such specialised semantics then the 
 * implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> value for any parameter 
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Considerations</h3>
 *
 * <p>When waiting upon a <tt>Condition</tt> a &quot;<em>spurious 
 * wakeup</em>&quot; is permitted to occur, in 
 * general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics.
 * This has little practical impact on most application programs as a
 * <tt>Condition</tt> should always be waited upon in a loop, testing
 * the state predicate that is being waited for. An implementation is
 * free to remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is 
 * recommended that applications programmers always assume that they can
 * occur and so always wait in a loop.
 *
 * <p>It is recognised that the three forms of condition waiting 
 * (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their ease of 
 * implementation on some platforms and in their performance characteristics.
 * In particular, it may be difficult to provide these features and maintain 
 * specific semantics such as ordering guarantees. 
 * Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the thread may 
 * not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.
 * <p>Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the 
 * same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it 
 * required to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.
 * <p>An implementation is required to
 * clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the 
 * waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption of 
 * thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined 
 * in this interface.
