/**
 * A <tt>Future</tt> represents the result of an asynchronous computation.
 * Methods are provided to check if the computation is complete,
 * to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the
 * computation.  The result can only be retrieved when the computation
 * has completed.  The <tt>get</tt> method will block until the computation
 * has completed.  Once the computation has completed, the result cannot
 * be changed, nor can the computation be restarted or cancelled.

 * class ImageRenderer { Image render(byte[] raw); }
 * class App {
 *   Executor executor = ...
 *   ImageRenderer renderer = ...
 *   void display(final byte[] rawimage) throws InterruptedException {

 *     executor.execute(futureImage);
 *     drawBorders(); // do other things while executing
 *     drawCaption();
 *     try {
 *       drawImage((Image)(futureImage.get())); // use future
