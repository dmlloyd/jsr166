/**
 * An object that executes submitted tasks.  This interface provides a way
 * of decoupling task execution from the mechanics of how that task will
 * be run, including construction of new threads, scheduling, etc.
 *
 * <p> An Executor can be thought of as a framework for executing
 * Runnables.  The executor manages queueing and scheduling of tasks,
 * and creation and teardown of threads.  Depending on which concrete
 * Executor class is being used, tasks may execute in a newly created
 * thread, an existing task-execution thread, or the thread calling
 * execute(), and may execute sequentially or concurrently.
 *
 * <p> Several concrete implementations of Executor are included in
 * java.util.concurrent, including ThreadPoolExecutor, a flexible thread
 * pool, SingleThreadedExecutor, which executes commands sequentially in
 * a background thread, and ScheduledExecutor, which adds support for timed,
 * delayed and periodic task execution.  Executor can be used in conjunction
 * with FutureTask (which implements Runnable) to asynchronously start
 * a potentially long-running computation and query the FutureTask to
 * determine if its execution has completed.
 *
 * <p> The <tt>Executors</tt> class provides factory methods for all of the
 * types of executors provided in <tt>java.util.concurrent</tt>.
