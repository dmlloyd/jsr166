/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion lock.  
 * <p><tt>ReentrantLock</tt> defines a stand-alone {@link Lock} class with 
 * the same basic behavior and semantics as the implicit
 * monitor lock accessed by the use of <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and
 * statements, but without the forced block-structured locking and unlocking
 * that occurs with <tt>synchronized</tt> methods and
 * statements. 
 * In a good implementation the performance characteristics of using a
 * <tt>ReentrantLock</tt> instance should be about the same as using 
 * monitors directly.
 *
 * <p><em>Only</em> use this class when you want normal locking semantics but
 * need to use the lock in a non-nested fashion.
 *
 * <p>The order in which blocked threads are granted the lock is not
 * specified.
 *
 * <p>If you want a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock then it is a simple
 * matter to use a reentrant lock in a non-reentrant way by ensuring that
 * the lock is not held by the current thread prior to locking.
 * See {@link #getHoldCount} for a way to check this.
 *
 *
 * <p><code>ReentrantLock</code> instances are intended to be used primarily 
 * in before/after constructions such as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class X {
 *   ReentrantLock lock;
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() { 
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This class supports the interruption of lock acquisition and provides a 
 * {@link #newCondition Condition} implemenatation that supports the 
 * interruption of thread suspension.
 *
 * <p>Except where noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> value for any parameter 
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
